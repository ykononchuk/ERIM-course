Description
-----------
<br /> The task for the course was to create a package for the R programming language.

<br /> The package contains an Add7Multiply function from 2 arguments. 
<br /> The function adds 7 to each of the elements of the first argument and multiplies vector of results on the corresponding elements of the second argument.  

**Unfortunately, there is only one function in the package, as I've noticed the exact wording of the part 2 of the excercise just now.** 
 

Usage Examples
--------------

<br /> v1 <- c(3,4,5)
<br /> v2 <- c(10,20)
<br /> result <- Add7Multiply (v1, v2) 
<br /> print(result)
